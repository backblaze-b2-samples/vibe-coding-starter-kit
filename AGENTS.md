# AGENTS.md

This is the authoritative control surface for all coding agents. Read this first.

## 1. Repository Map

```
apps/web/          Next.js 16 frontend (App Router, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui)
services/api/      FastAPI backend (layered: types/config/repo/service/runtime)
packages/shared/   Shared TypeScript types
docs/              System of record (product specs, security, reliability)
infra/railway/     Deployment config
plans/             Execution plans and reasoning artifacts
```

## 2. Architectural Invariants

**Backend layering**: `types` -> `config` -> `repo` -> `service` -> `runtime`

- No backward imports across layers
- No `boto3` outside `repo/`
- No business logic in route handlers (`runtime/`)
- All external APIs wrapped in `repo/` adapters
- All request/response data validated at boundary (Pydantic models)
- No shared mutable state across layers

**Frontend**: shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/` are generated — never modify them.

## 3. Quality Expectations

- **DRY** — do not duplicate logic, types, or constants. Extract shared code only when used in 2+ places.
- Structured JSON logging only — no `print()` statements
- No raw SDK calls outside `repo/` layer
- Files stay under 300 lines
- Tests added or updated for every behavior change
- Docs updated in same PR as code changes
- Lint clean before merge
- Prefer boring, composable libraries over clever abstractions
- No implicit type assumptions — use typed models

## 4. Mechanical Enforcement

| Rule | Enforced by |
|------|-------------|
| No backward imports | `tests/test_structure.py::test_no_backward_imports` |
| No boto3 outside repo/ | `tests/test_structure.py::test_boto3_only_in_repo` |
| File size < 300 lines | `tests/test_structure.py::test_file_size_limits` |
| All layers exist | `tests/test_structure.py::test_all_layers_exist` |
| No bare print() | `ruff` rule T20 |
| Import ordering | `ruff` rule I001 |
| Frontend strict equality | `eslint` rule eqeqeq |
| No unused vars | `eslint` + `ruff` rules |

## 5. Commands

```bash
# Run
pnpm dev               # start both frontend and backend
pnpm dev:web           # frontend only
pnpm dev:api           # backend only

# Test & Lint
pnpm lint              # frontend lint (eslint)
pnpm build             # frontend type check + build
pnpm lint:api          # backend lint (ruff)
pnpm test:api          # backend tests (pytest)
pnpm check:structure   # structural boundary tests
pnpm test:e2e          # Playwright e2e tests
```

## 6. Agent Workflow

1. Read this file first.
2. Review [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) before structural changes.
3. For non-trivial changes, create a plan in `plans/YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md`.
4. Implement the smallest coherent change.
5. Run: `pnpm lint && pnpm lint:api && pnpm test:api && pnpm check:structure`
6. Update docs in the same PR (see §8).
7. Only change files relevant to the task. No drive-by improvements.

## 7. Frontend Conventions

- Tailwind v4: config via CSS `@theme` blocks, NOT `tailwind.config.ts`
- Colors: OKLch format
- Dark mode: `next-themes` with `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))`
- Animations: `tw-animate-css` (not `tailwindcss-animate`)

## 8. Doc Update Mapping

| Change Type | Update Location |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Feature logic, inputs, outputs | `docs/product-specs/<feature>.md` |
| System layout, deployments | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Setup or scope changes | `README.md` |
| Security changes | `docs/SECURITY.md` |
| Reliability changes | `docs/RELIABILITY.md` |

If documentation and implementation conflict, update docs in the same PR. Documentation rot destroys agent reliability.

## 9. Where to Find More Context

| Topic | Location |
|-------|----------|
| System layout, data flows, boundaries | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Product specifications | [docs/product-specs/](docs/product-specs/) |
| Security principles | [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) |
| Reliability expectations | [docs/RELIABILITY.md](docs/RELIABILITY.md) |
| Execution plans | [plans/](plans/) |

## 10. When Unsure

- Prefer boring, stable libraries
- Prefer small PRs over large changes
- Add tests with every change
- Never bypass lint rules without explicit instruction
- Ask before making destructive or irreversible changes
