# Security

Security principles and implementation for the vibe-coding-starter-kit.

## Trust Boundaries

- **Frontend -> API**: CORS-restricted to configured origins, scoped to `GET/POST/DELETE/OPTIONS`
- **API -> B2**: Authenticated via `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` + `B2_APPLICATION_KEY`, signature v4
- **Client -> B2**: Presigned URLs for download (10-min expiry, `Content-Disposition: attachment`)

## Upload Validation

- Filename sanitization: path traversal, null bytes, unsafe chars stripped
- MIME/extension consistency check against allowlist
- Chunked streaming with size enforcement (100MB default)
- Content-type allowlist (images, PDFs, text, archives, audio/video)
- Empty file rejection

## File Key Validation

- All file endpoints require keys to start with allowed prefixes (`uploads/`)
- Path traversal patterns rejected (`../`, `%2e%2e`, null bytes)

## Download Safety

- Presigned URLs force `Content-Disposition: attachment`
- Prevents inline rendering of user-uploaded content (XSS mitigation)

## Secrets Management

- All secrets loaded via environment variables (pydantic-settings)
- Never committed to source control
- `.env.example` documents required variables without values

## Agent Security Rules

- Never commit `.env`, credentials, or API keys
- Never weaken validation without explicit instruction
- Never bypass CORS, auth, or input sanitization
- Always validate at system boundaries
